# Dorm to Wolly's Speedrun

This **NEW** speedrun must originates from the iconic first speedrun from West Village F to Wolly's done by [neuspeedruns](https://www.reddit.com/user/neuspeedruns/). To allow others to get in on this iconic run, it is being modified to allow runners to start from their own dorm, where they will be placed into a sub-leaderboard based on their dorm. 

This run must begin from within your dorm. The time traditionally would start upon opening your dorm room's door, and would end upon entering your dorm room's door on the return. Because there is an inherit advantage to those located close to the exit of their dorm, runners from the same dorm should coordinate a common starting location to make the run more fair. This will obviously vary from dorm to dorm, so please check the discord server and/or the leaderboards below to figure out where to start. 

In order for the run to be valid, the runner **must** make a purchase at any "Wollaston's Market". The current meta depends upon which Wollaston's your dorm is closest to. No major optimizations have been found for this run, aside from the  advantage of going to Wollaston's during a time of low NPC activity.

The 100% category is for those runners who purchase an item. The any% category traditionally was the same run without making a purchase, however, this run is being *removed due to a lack of runners and to minimize leaderboard clutter. 

If you want to do this run without spending money, you still have to get to the Wollaston's door, and there will be a **1 minute penalty** added on to your time to make up for the lack of a purchase.
