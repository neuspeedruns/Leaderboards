# West Village F to Wolly's Speedrun

## Categories:
This speedrun must begin from within your dorm in West Village F. The time starts upon opening your dorm room's door, and ends upon opening the same door upon your return. In order for the run to be valid, the runner **must** make a purchase at any "Wollaston's Market". The current meta is to go to the nearest one located in the first floor of a neighboring West Village building. No major optimizations have been found for this run, aside from the obvious advantage to those who spawn in a lower floor in WVF, and going to Wollaston's during a time of low NPC activity.

The 100% category is for those runners who purchase an item. If you would rather save money, the any% category allows you to skip the actual purchase part of the run.
