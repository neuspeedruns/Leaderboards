# Cabot Testing Center (COVID Test) Speedrun

This speedrun has **a few specific rules** that **must be followed**:
- No recording/photos can be taken within the Cabot Testing Center
- All COVID-19 guidelines MUST be followed
- All procedures within Cabot Testing Center MUST be properly followed (no rushing your nasal swap, no cutting the line, etc.)

If any of these rules are broken, your run will not be counted and you may not be allowed to submit future runs. (We don't want this speedrun thing to get shutdown).

Anyway, this speedrun is simple. The time starts as soon as your Daily Wellness Check is scanned in front of cabot. All recording must be done by another person who will remain outside the testing center the whole time. The other person will record you from a distance, and then walk around to the other side of Cabot to wait for your exit. Your time stops as soon as you exit the facility, which the other person will record occuring from outside.
