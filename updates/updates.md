# NEU Speed Runs: Updates and Upcoming Features

## Upcoming Features/Patches
- **New Runs (to be voted into live categories soon)**: 
  - **Tunnels**: Run between all buildings connected by tunnels (Credit: BiggerMak & book)
  - **Beanpot Run**: Northeastern -> BU -> Harvard! All in one long run. Public transportation is allowed of course! (Credit: book)
  - **Cy Young to Fenway Gate B**: A 0.8 mile sprint from Cy Young's iconic statue near Hayden and Churchill Hall to Fenway Park's Gate B. An total endurance run! (Credit: book)
  - **Four Parking Garages**: The twin of the iconic *Four Bridges* speedrun. This run requires the runner to run between the four parking garages on campus: West Village PG, Renaissance PG, Columbus PG, Gainsborough PG. (Credit: Kings of West Willis)
- **Modified Runs**:
  - **WVF to Wolly's** will be changed to **Dorm to Wolly's**. There will still be separate leaderboards based on which dorm you are starting in, however this will allow for more people to get in on this popular run
- **Website Commenting**
  - This was a popular suggestion that would allow people to comment on runs posted on the website. This feature will likely take a week or so, as we first need to rebuild the backend of the site to have these capabilities
- **Discord Server**
  - Anyone familiar with the speedrunning scene knows that speedrunning communities discuss routing, new tricks/timesaves, and meet new people through the use of a discord server. We are pleased to announce that the `NEU Speedruns` discord server will be up in running within the next few days.
  - We are looking for moderators for the server. Anyone who is interested will be given a moderator role, as long as they want to be involved in this community for the long run. Please email us if interested at: [neuspeedruns@gmail.com](mailto:neuspeedruns@gmail.com) 
- **Official Club/Organization Through NEU**
  - Have we taken this meme too far? Perhaps. This is likely far out in the future, however if enough people are interested in making this an official organization, we will look into making this happen.

## Previous Patch Notes/Updates:
- **Website Launch**
  - September 20th, 2020
