# NEU Speed Runs
This website contains the leaderboards for all NEU related speedruns. This site was created to allow students to compete in a series of different on-campus speedruns. That being said, please remember that the purpose of this is entirely for fun, and should never be taken too far in terms of putting anyone at risk (i.e. running very fast through crowded areas, breaking on-campus rules, etc.). Please remember to have fun, be competitve, and stay safe.

This website is a work in progress. For patch notes and **awesome upcoming features**, see [here](updates/updates.md).

## News: [Official Discord Server <img src="img/discord.png" width="30" align="center">](https://discord.gg/wU7gCkM)
Anyone familiar with the speedrunning scene knows that speedrunning communities discuss routing, new tricks/timesaves, and meet new people through the use of a discord server. For these reasons, we are proud to announce the launch of the [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wU7gCkM) for the NEU Speedrunning Community. 

It will take a few days to populate with everyone, but we are confident that this will become a great community of people over the Fall Semester. 

It's also important to note that you don't have to be a "speedrunner" to join this community. Whether you want to get the next world record in one of our competitve categories, submit a run for fun, keep track of the current runners, or just meet new people, this community is for you! So be sure to spread the word to friends! We look forward to talking with you all soon on the Server!

Join the server [here](https://discord.gg/wU7gCkM)!

## FAQ

#### How long will it take for my run to get verified on the site?
In the future, it will be very quick. While the functionality for automatically adding runs to the site is still being developed, it could take anywhere from 15 minutes to a few days. Apologies for any delay

#### Like to get involved?
Feel free to email us: [neuspeedruns@gmail.com](mailto:neuspeedruns@gmail.com) 

#### Is this an official "thing" run through the University?
No, this is a student run simple webpage hosted through github pages.

#### Can I help Mod the discord server?
We currently have a couple mods, but we are happy to take on more people! Speedrunning discord servers are usually quite community run, so everyone will have a decent amount of permissions as a spectator/runner.
